# CS350_emergingSystems

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
This project was meant to provide the basic software infrastructure for a simple thermostat as a way of exploring imbedded system hardware and how to interact with it.

What did you do particularly well?
I felt that I kept the code simple and readable without adding in unnecessary modularity that could take up storage and memory that might not be available on many imbedded systems.

Where could you improve?
I could have improved the output formatting of the debugging and logging messages.

What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
There was often a need to review source and hardware documentation in order to create a functional product and put the various modules together cohesively. This skill in particular will benefit me going forward I anticipate.

How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
Without great options for making the programs modular, it was important to comment extensively and to limit adjustments to only the necessary modules.
